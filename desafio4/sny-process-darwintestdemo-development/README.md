# Darwin Spring Boot sny-process-darwintestdemo Function

## Features

### Description

Microservice sny-process-darwintestdemo generated from the Maven archetype for Darwin Spring Boot applications.
The microservice sny-process-darwintestdemo implements an application of type Servlet, which exposes a handler, and basic endpoints to process GET requests.

The microservice sny-process-darwintestdemo, makes use of Darwin Spring Boot Starter Parent, so there is no need to worry about the version of the libraries it makes use of, or to provide a list of all available dependencies.

!!! note

    For more information on how to generate a microservice from the Darwin archetype, please refer to the following link: [Darwin Spring Boot Archetype Microservice](https://gluon.dev.corp/microservices/docs/darwin-spring-boot/current/darwin-archetypes/darwin-spring-boot-archetype-microservice/index.html)

### Dependency management

The microservice sny-process-darwintestdemo makes use of the following Maven dependencies:

* [Spring Cloud Config Client](https://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-config/reference/html/#_spring_cloud_config_client)
* [Spring Web MVC](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/current/reference/html/web.html)
* [Springdoc-OpenAPI (Swagger)](https://springdoc.org/)
* [Spring Boot Actuator](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/actuator.html)
* Spring HTTP Clients: [RestTemplate y WebClient](https://github.com/santander-group-shared-assets/gln-back-darwin-java-samples/tree/develop/webclient)

* Framework Darwin Spring Boot:
- [Darwin Core](https://gluon.dev.corp/microservices/docs/darwin-spring-boot/current/darwin-project/darwin-spring-boot-core/)
- [Darwin Cache](https://gluon.dev.corp/microservices/docs/darwin-spring-boot/current/darwin-project/darwin-spring-boot-cache/)
- [Darwin Logging](https://gluon.dev.corp/microservices/docs/darwin-spring-boot/current/darwin-project/darwin-spring-boot-logging/)
- [Darwin Authentication](https://gluon.dev.corp/microservices/docs/darwin-spring-boot/current/darwin-project/darwin-spring-boot-security-authentication/)
- [Darwin OmniChannel](https://gluon.dev.corp/microservices/docs/darwin-spring-boot/current/darwin-project/darwin-spring-boot-omnichannel/)

## Project structure

The microservice sny-process-darwintestdemo has the following structure:

The `src/main/java` folder includes :

- An **Application.java** class to start the application using the appropriate `WebApplicationType`.
- A `config` package with **Configuration** class like **SwaggerConfig.java** class that implements a configuration for using the OpenApi documentation in a microservice.
- A `infra` package with classes necessaries to call data layer like `infra/repository` for database or `infra/mainframe` for Partenon.
- A `service` package with the services that the microservice will use, share model with web layer.
- A `web` package with all controllers that expose the endpoints of the microservice.
- A `model` package with the models exposed by controller in `web`package.

!!! note

    If you choose the `API First` option, then the `web` and `model` packages will not be part of the archetype, because they are autogenerated by the openapi-generator-maven-plugin.


In addition, the microservice has:

- An **application.yml** file together with an *application-local.properties* file with the [properties](#configuration-files).
  necessary to configure the project.
- An **errors.properties** file for the [configuration of exceptions](https://gluon.dev.corp/microservices/docs/darwin-spring-boot/current/darwin-project/darwin-spring-boot-core/index.html#excepciones), and a subfolder errors with a Resource Bundle of configurations, for multi-language exceptions (in this case: Spanish (es_ES) and US English (en_US)).
- The **pom.xml** file, which contains all the information that Maven uses to manage dependencies, metadata, etc.
- An **ApplicationTest.java** to test that the functionality of the application works correctly. Also the corresponding tests for classes: **SwaggerConfigTest.java** y **HelloControllerTest.java**.
  

## Configuration files

The project has a number of property files to configure what is needed in relation to the libraries used:

### _application.yml_

Main configuration file of the environment-independent application.
In this file, properties related to the architecture components and those of the application itself are configured.

This file contains the following properties of architecture components:

| Property                                                | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | Required                          | Value                                       | Environment |

Among others, this file allows the definition of properties to be able to identify the application. By default, it points to the "boae" *region* and the active profile is the *local* one. To identify the application in the monitoring systems too, *entity* property are set by default with "ESP" value.

	darwin:
	    region: boae
	    suffix:
	    logging:
            entity: ESP
	...
	
	spring:
	    application:
            name: application-1
	    profiles:
            active: local
	...

### _application-local.properties_

Auxiliary file with properties associated with the environment (in this case for a local environment).
It has a property called `darwin.logging.console-log-format` that allows to change the technical console log format.
By default is set to the value 'HUMAN_READABLE' to show the Console Technical Log Pattern but it can be changed to 'JSON' to show the Technical Log Pattern instead.
It has the PKM and STS properties of the security library and the property to define the kafka server with which to connect the logging library, which is empty by default.
In case of working on another profile, it will be necessary to create another properties file for the particular profile.


## Spring Actuator: Liveness and Readiness.

Spring's actuators provide a set of HTTP/JMX endpoints that expose operational information about our microservice.
Darwin makes use of the '/actuator/health/liveness' and '/actuator/health/readiness' actuator endpoints to manage the Liveness and Readiness probes of a microservice.

- Liveness probe: Provides information that lets us know if the microservice is alive or dead.
- Readiness probe: Provides information that lets us know if the microservice is ready to receive traffic.

These endpoints, by default, will only be enabled when the execution environment is detected to be Kubernetes as they are the endpoints we will use to define the health checks of the container.

- Liveness health checks: Kubernetes uses this health check to know if the application is alive or dead.
  So if the application is alive Kubernetes does nothing but if it is dead it deletes the Pod and starts a new one to replace it.
- Readiness health checks: Kubernetes uses this health check to know if the microservice is ready to receive traffic.
  Kubernetes makes sure that the microservice is ready to receive requests before the pod accepts them.
  If the healthcheck starts to fail, Kubernetes stops routing requests to the pod until the microservice is in a state that allows it to receive them.

In the [application.yml](#application.yml) , the properties that are applied by default are:

    management:
	    health:
		defaults.enabled: true
		livenessState.enabled: true
		readinessState.enabled: true

!!! note

    Does not need to be explicitly added* in the file of the microservice.

If you want to use the endpoints in a local environment, Spring provides the property **_management.health.probes.enabled_** that you have to add to the _application.yml_ file.

An example of call and response of the liveness probe, would be the following.
Using the endpoint 'http://localhost:8080/actuator/health/liveness' we would get a response indicating the internal status of the application.
When the status is OK, we get a response with HTTP=200 code and content:

	// HTTP/1.1 200 OK
	
	{
	"status": "UP",
	    "components": {
		"livenessProbe": {
		    "status": "UP"
		}
      }
	}


Similarly, to obtain the readiness probe, we use the endpoint 'http://localhost:8080/actuator/health/readiness'.
In this case we show an example that indicates that the application is not ready to receive requests:

	// HTTP/1.1 503 SERVICE UNAVAILABLE
	
	{
	"status": "OUT_OF_SERVICE",
	    "components": {
		"readinessProbe": {
		    "status": "OUT_OF_SERVICE"
		}
        }
	}

For more information on Liveness and Readiness, please refer to the following entries: [Spring Liveness and Readiness Probes](https://spring.io/blog/2020/03/25/liveness-and-readiness-probes-with-spring-boot) and [Health Check Microservices Java](https://sanes.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SANACLOUD/pages/16546334525/Health+Check)

## Execution of the application

To execute our function application we go to the `Application` class, where the main method is located.

	@SpringBootApplication
	@EnableCaching 
        
	public class Application {
	
	public static void main(String[] args) {
			
		  new SpringApplicationBuilder(Application.class).web(WebApplicationType.SERVLET).run(args);}

This class has the tags:

* `@SpringBootApplication` which indicates that it is a Spring boot application and causes it to activate.
  the Scan component and the autoconfigurations.
* `@EnableCaching` which enables the use of the cache in the application, managed by the darwin-spring-boot-cache library.
* `@Slf4j` generates a logger, and then the darwin-spring-boot-logging library connects to it.

To run the application, we go to the project directory and execute the following command:

    mvn spring-boot:run

Also, it is possible to run the application using the test profile with the 'ApplicationTestRun' class and the following command

    mvn spring-boot:test-run

When you run it, you will see the following log:


    :: Spring Boot  (v2.6.11.RELEASE) ::                                                                  :: DARWIN (v3.1.2-RELEASE) ::

and the application would be up.

The microservice has a controller, which is the highest level layer for exposing our REST microservice.
This is defined in the `HelloControler` class.
To call the controller we use the `/sny-process-darwintestdemo/hello` endpoint indicated in the `@RequestMapping` tag.

By executing the following command:

    curl -X GET "http://localhost:8080/sny-process-darwintestdemo/hello"

We will get a response like this:

    Hello world!

Or an incorrect one in case of no authorization.
